# Continuous Simulation Model

This project implements a continuous simulation model in Python. It is designed to simulate and analyze dynamic systems over time using numerical methods.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Entry point of the simulation model
│   ├── model.py         # Core simulation logic and equations
│   └── utils.py         # Utility functions for data processing and plotting
├── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies required for the project
└── README.md             # Documentation for the project
```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the simulation model, execute the `main.py` file:

```
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the simulation parameters, run the simulation, and output the results.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib

Make sure to install these packages before running the simulation.
